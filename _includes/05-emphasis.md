# Way Too Emphasize

---

Some of the items that you can use to markdown file is the _italics_ using '_' or ' * ' or the **bold** using ' ** ' or ' __ '.

You can also use a combination to get multiple types of emphasis on the same **_item_**.

Crossing out text is as easy as using two tildes ~~ which will ~~crossout~~ any text.
